# Imagination

Quick and dirty image library utility to have pictures sorted and deduplicated.

Requirements are split into `requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` so that test dependencies can be installed separately. Intellij runners are included. Developed with python venv 3.10.3 on macOS.
